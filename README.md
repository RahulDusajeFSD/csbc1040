Deploying Node App to Google App Engine.

1) Clone the repo - https://github.com/RahulDusajeFSD/csbc1040.git  into your local system (branch - main)

2) Open the code repo in VSCode
   
3) In the project structure run the following commands

- npm start
- npm run buil // To verify successful building of Node project - The build folder gets created in project root directory with build files.

4) Create a New Project on GCP Console.

5) Authenticate GCloud Account using -> gcloud auth login

6) Set Default Project using -> gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

7) Add app.yaml file to your project. In our case I have added the file below:

   runtime: nodejs16  // it defines thr runtime for Nodejs
   
handlers:
- url: /.*   // To match incoming requests - in our case it will match to any URL path
  script: auto

8) Deploy the App using -> gcloud app deploy

9) Access the App in the url generated by gcloud. In our case the url generated is - https://node-app-demo-412021.ue.r.appspot.com
