Deploying Node App to AWS using AWS Amplify.

1) Clone the repo - https://github.com/RahulDusajeFSD/csbc1040.git  into your local system (branch - main)

2) Open the code repo in VSCode
   
3) In the project structure run the following commands

- npm start
- npm run buil // To verify successful building of Node project - The build folder gets created in project root directory with build files.

4) Open AWS Simpplify console.

5) GoTo New App -> Host Web App
   
6) Select Version Control - GitHub.

7) Map the GitHub Repo, branch and monodirectory(if reqd.)

8) Provide an App Name for AWS Amplify

9) The yml script is below:

   version: 1
applications:
  - frontend:
      phases:
        preBuild:
          commands:
            - npm ci
        build:
          commands: [npm run build]
      artifacts:
        baseDirectory: build
        files:
          - '**/*'
      cache:
        paths:
          - node_modules/**/*

MAKE SURE to have build command and build directory (build in our case) and appRoot (if reqd.)

10) Goto Save and Deploy.

11) Check for Provisioning, Build and Deploy Stages.
